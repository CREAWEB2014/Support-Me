# Contributing to Support Me

Code contributions are welcome, as are bug reports or enhancement requests in the form of GitHub issues.

Every pull request should accompany a GitHub issue and reference the issue number (#1) in the description.

Development currently happens in the `master` branch, so please generate pull requests against that branch.

If you have a question, submit an issue. If you'd prefer to get in touch directly, ping me on Twitter at [@DrewAPicture](https://twitter.com/DrewAPicture).
